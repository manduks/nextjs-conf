        The Final Speech from The Great Dictator
      </h2>

        I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I
        don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone -
        if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one
        another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s
        happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and
        despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the
        good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be
        free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

        Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight
        to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with
        national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.
        Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress
        will lead to all men’s happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy,
        let us all unite!
